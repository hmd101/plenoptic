    "1. **Definitions**:\n",
    "    - Let $ s_t $ represent the image frame at time step $ t $.\n",
    "    - Let $ s_{t+k} $ represent the image frame at time step $ t+k $, which is $ k $ time steps after $ s_t $.\n",
    "2. **Problem Statement**:\n",
    "    - **a)** Compute the geodesic distance between $ s_t $ and $ s_{t+k} $ in a suitable image embedding space.\n",
    "    - **b)** Sample intermediate image frames that lie on the geodesic path between $ s_t $ and $ s_{t+k} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proposed Solution**:\n",
    "    - **a)** Using a pretrained network's second-to-last layer as an embedding space, as embedding should meaningfully capture the content of the images due to the network's prior training on a potentially large and diverse dataset\n",
    "    - **b)** Intermediate Frames:\n",
    "        - i) interpolate and generate intermediate frames by gradient-based optimization w.r.t. target image in pixel space (Note: could be computationally intensive and might not always produce visually coherent transitions, especially if $ s_{\\text{start}} $ and $ s_{\\text{target}} $ are substantially different).\n",
    "        - ii) Image morphing techniques\n",
    "        - iii) Variational Autoencodes (VAE)\n",
    "        - iv) Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "    - Let $ f $ be a neural network function that maps an image to a lower-dimensional embedding space, i.e., $ f: \\mathcal{I} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d $ where $ \\mathcal{I} $ is the space of images.\n",
    "    - Define the geodesic distance $ d $ between  $s_t$  and $s_{t+k}$ as $ d(s_t, s_{t+k}) = \\| f(s_t) - f(s_{t+k}) \\| $, where $ \\| \\cdot \\| $ denotes the Euclidean norm.\n",
    "    - Intermediate frames  $s_{t+i}$  for $ i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k-1 $ are generated by $ s_{t+i} = g(\\theta_{t+i}) $, where $ \\theta_{t+i} $ is a parameter vector obtained by interpolating between parameters representing $ s_t $ and $ s_{t+k} $ in the embedding space."
